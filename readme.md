# 🕵️‍♂️ DeepRecon

**The no-cap next-gen Dark Web OSINT engine that runs on literal ✨magic✨.**  
*But seriously, it’s a fully asynchronous, modular, and auto-scaling reconnaissance framework built for security researchers who actually want results without the headache.*

## 🚀 Wait, What is DeepRecon?

Stop running 5 different scripts manually. DeepRecon is a fully automated engine designed to map, index, and fingerprint target nodes inside the Tor network (`.onion`). 
We're talking: 
- 🏎️ **Ludicrous Speed**: Non-blocking `aiohttp` SOCKS5 connections.
- 🧠 **Smart Crawling**: BFS traversal with duplicate-link avoidance and resilient memory caching.
- 🔍 **Full Text Search (FTS5)**: Finding what you need across gigabytes of indexed content instantly. 
- 🤖 **Auto-Extraction**: Regular Expressions? Nah, we dynamically scrape PGP keys, Cryptocoin Wallets (BTC, XMR), emails, tech-stack footprints (`fingerprinter`), and language data effortlessly.
- 💅 **Web & CLI Drip**: An interactive Rich-powered CLI or a sleek FastAPI-driven Dashboard. You pick.

Security Pros: It’s the modular Swiss Army Knife you wish you had yesterday.

## ⚙️ The "It Just Works" Installation

We built scripts because configuring environments shouldn't be a hurdle. **It auto-installs Tor, Python dependencies, and virtual environments.**

### 🐧 Linux/Debian/Kali user?
```bash
./install.sh
```

### 🪟 Windows?
```cmd
install.bat
```

> **Expert mode unlocked:** During install, we bind `deeprecon` directly to your path so you can call it locally from anywhere. 

*(Manual path)*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure Tor daemon is running!
```

## 🎮 How to Wield It

Run the framework. Period.

### 🌐 Web Interface Mode
Launch the local web dashboard for point-and-click intelligence gathering:
```bash
deeprecon --web --port 8000
```
Open `http://localhost:8000` to start scanning and exploring your database.

### 💻 Elite CLI Mode
Stay in the terminal with our non-ending interactive loops:
```bash
deeprecon --cli
```
*What happens next?* The loop walks you through adding targets, kicking off asynchronous spiders, or searching your datasets on the fly.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Extensibility

We hate monolithic messes. Inside, you'll find:

- **`core/`**: The asynchronous heart pumping bytes (`crawler.py`, `parser.py`).
- **`plugins/`**: Drop a new `.py` file inheriting `BasePlugin` here, and DeepRecon auto-detects it. Boom, new feature deployed.
- **`storage/`**: Safe, trigger-bypassing FTS5 SQLite row-replacement that refuses to corrupt.
- **`web/` & `main.py`**: The dynamic frontends masking the sheer complexity behind the scenes.

**Need a custom parser?** Just copy `plugins/fingerprinter.py`, adjust the signatures, and you're parsing new artifacts.

## 🔒 OpSec Warning

This tool is built for **Ethical Security Research**. Interacting with `.onion` addresses inherently carries risk. DeepRecon masks user-agents and dynamically routes traffic, but it relies on your configured OPSEC rules. **Never operate without Tor running correctly.** Stay safe, fam.
